  "content": "# ElizaOS Plugins: Extending Your Agent's Capabilities\n\nOne of the most powerful aspects of **ElizaOS** is its extensible plugin system. Rather than building a monolithic framework that tries to do everything, ElizaOS takes a modular approach—letting developers add exactly the capabilities they need through plugins. In this guide, we'll explore how plugins work, showcase popular options, and walk through creating your own.\n\n## Understanding the Plugin Architecture\n\nAt its heart, an ElizaOS plugin is a packaged set of functionalities that extend what your agent can do. Plugins can add:\n\n- **Actions**: Specific tasks the agent can perform\n- **Providers**: Services that supply data or capabilities\n- **Evaluators**: Components that analyze and assess situations\n- **Services**: Background processes that run continuously\n\nThis modular design means you only load what you need, keeping your agent lean and efficient.\n\n## How Plugins Work\n\nWhen your agent starts up, ElizaOS loads the plugins specified in your character configuration. Each plugin registers its capabilities with the runtime, making them available for use.\n\nHere's a simplified view of the plugin lifecycle:\n\n1. **Registration**: Plugin declares its actions, providers, and services\n2. **Initialization**: Plugin sets up connections, loads resources\n3. **Execution**: Agent uses plugin capabilities as needed\n4. **Cleanup**: Plugin releases resources on shutdown\n\n## Popular Built-in Plugins\n\n### Twitter Plugin (@eliza/plugin-twitter)\n\nThe Twitter plugin transforms your agent into a social media presence. Capabilities include:\n\n- **Posting tweets**: Share updates, thoughts, and content\n- **Replying to mentions**: Engage with users who tag your agent\n- **Following/unfollowing**: Build and curate your network\n- **Searching and monitoring**: Track topics and conversations\n- **Direct messages**: Private communications with followers\n\nThis plugin is essential for building AI influencers, community managers, or marketing bots.\n\n### Telegram Plugin (@eliza/plugin-telegram)\n\nBring your agent to Telegram's massive user base:\n\n- **Bot conversations**: One-on-one chats with users\n- **Group participation**: Join and interact in group chats\n- **Inline queries**: Respond to mentions in any chat\n- **Rich media**: Send images, files, and formatted messages\n\n### Discord Plugin (@eliza/plugin-discord)\n\nPerfect for Web3 communities that live on Discord:\n\n- **Server moderation**: Monitor and manage conversations\n- **Command responses**: React to slash commands\n- **Channel management**: Post in specific channels\n- **Voice integration**: Join voice channels for audio interaction\n\n### Solana Plugin (@eliza/plugin-solana)\n\nAdd blockchain capabilities for the Solana ecosystem:\n\n- **Wallet management**: Create and manage Solana wallets\n- **Token transfers**: Send and receive SOL and SPL tokens\n- **DEX integration**: Trade on Raydium, Jupiter, and other DEXs\n- **NFT operations**: Mint, transfer, and query NFTs\n\n### EVM Plugin (@eliza/plugin-evm)\n\nFor Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains:\n\n- **Multi-chain support**: Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum, and more\n- **Smart contract interaction**: Read and write to contracts\n- **Token operations**: ERC-20 and ERC-721 support\n- **DeFi integrations**: Connect to Uniswap, Aave, and other protocols\n\n## Specialized Plugins\n\n### Trading and DeFi\n\n- **@eliza/plugin-coinbase**: Coinbase API integration for trading\n- **@eliza/plugin-birdeye**: Real-time token data and analytics\n- **@eliza/plugin-0x**: Decentralized exchange aggregation\n\n### Data and Analysis\n\n- **@eliza/plugin-web-search**: Search the web for information\n- **@eliza/plugin-news**: Fetch and analyze news articles\n- **@eliza/plugin-image**: Generate and analyze images\n\n### Productivity\n\n- **@eliza/plugin-github**: Interact with GitHub repositories\n- **@eliza/plugin-email**: Send and receive emails\n- **@eliza/plugin-calendar**: Schedule and manage events\n\n## Installing and Configuring Plugins\n\n### Basic Installation\n\nMost plugins are installed via npm or pnpm:\n\n```bash\npnpm add @eliza/plugin-twitter\n```\n\n### Character Configuration\n\nAdd plugins to your character file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"MyAgent\",\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"@eliza/plugin-twitter\",\n    \"@eliza/plugin-solana\"\n  ],\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"twitter\": {\n      \"username\": \"my_bot\",\n      \"postFrequency\": \"2h\"\n    },\n    \"solana\": {\n      \"network\": \"mainnet-beta\",\n      \"walletPath\": \"./wallet.json\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\nMost plugins require credentials stored in environment variables:\n\n```env\n# Twitter\nTWITTER_USERNAME=my_bot\nTWITTER_PASSWORD=secret\nTWITTER_EMAIL=bot@example.com\n\n# Solana\nSOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key\nSOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com\n```\n\n## Creating Your Own Plugin\n\nReady to extend ElizaOS with custom functionality? Here's a basic template:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Plugin, Action, Provider } from '@eliza/core';\n\nconst myCustomAction: Action = {\n  name: 'MY_CUSTOM_ACTION',\n  description: 'Performs a custom task',\n  handler: async (runtime, message) => {\n    // Your action logic here\n    return {\n      success: true,\n      message: 'Action completed!'\n    };\n  }\n};\n\nconst myPlugin: Plugin = {\n  name: 'my-custom-plugin',\n  description: 'Adds custom capabilities',\n  actions: [myCustomAction],\n  providers: [],\n  services: []\n};\n\nexport default myPlugin;\n```\n\n### Plugin Best Practices\n\n**Keep it focused**: Each plugin should do one thing well. If your plugin is growing too large, consider splitting it.\n\n**Handle errors gracefully**: Plugins shouldn't crash the entire agent. Catch and log errors appropriately.\n\n**Document everything**: Clear documentation helps other developers (and future you) understand how to use the plugin.\n\n**Test thoroughly**: Write tests for your actions and services to ensure reliability.\n\n**Respect rate limits**: When integrating with external APIs, implement proper rate limiting and backoff strategies.\n\n## Plugin Composition\n\nThe real power of ElizaOS emerges when you combine multiple plugins. Consider an agent with:\n\n- **Twitter** for social presence\n- **Solana** for trading\n- **Birdeye** for market data\n\nThis agent could:\n\n1. Monitor Twitter for trending tokens\n2. Analyze market data via Birdeye\n3. Execute trades on Solana DEXs\n4. Tweet about successful trades\n\nAll running autonomously, 24/7.\n\n## Community Plugins\n\nThe ElizaOS community is constantly creating new plugins. You can find community contributions:\n\n- **GitHub**: Search for \"eliza plugin\" repositories\n- **Discord**: Join the ElizaOS Discord for plugin announcements\n- **npm**: Browse packages with the \"@eliza\" scope\n\nBefore using community plugins, always:\n- Review the source code\n- Check for recent updates and maintenance\n- Look at issue reports and community feedback\n\n## Future of the Plugin Ecosystem\n\nThe ElizaOS plugin ecosystem is rapidly evolving. Upcoming developments include:\n\n- **Plugin marketplace**: A curated registry of verified plugins\n- **Plugin templates**: Scaffolding tools for faster development\n- **Cross-plugin communication**: Standardized ways for plugins to interact\n- **Plugin versioning**: Better compatibility management\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPlugins are what transform ElizaOS from a simple chatbot framework into a powerful platform for autonomous agents. Whether you're using built-in plugins, community contributions, or building your own, the modular architecture ensures you can create exactly the agent you envision.\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that the community continuously expands what's possible. Every new plugin adds capabilities that benefit the entire ecosystem, making ElizaOS more powerful with each contribution.\n\n---\n\n*Want to contribute a plugin?
