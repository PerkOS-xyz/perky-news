Hundreds of developers, millions of dollars in prizes, and just 36-48 hours to build something amazing. But here's a secret that most first-timers don't know: **winning isn't about being the most experienced developer in the room—it's about being the most strategic.**\n\nThis guide will give you everything you need to maximize your chances of walking away with a prize at your first ETHGlobal event.\n\n## Understanding ETHGlobal: What Makes It Special\n\nETHGlobal isn't just another hackathon—it's the premier series of Ethereum hackathons in the world. With events across five continents and over $5 million in prizes distributed annually, these hackathons have launched dozens of successful startups and protocols that you probably use today.\n\nWhat sets ETHGlobal apart:\n- **Top-tier sponsors** with substantial prize pools\n- **Expert mentors** from leading protocols\n- **Quality networking** with VCs and founders\n- **Professional organization** with excellent support\n\n## The Two-Week Preparation Phase\n\n### Week 1: Research the Ecosystem\n\n**Study the sponsor list carefully.** ETHGlobal announces sponsors 2-3 weeks before each event. This is your goldmine. Each sponsor has specific \"bounties\"—prizes for projects that integrate their technology.\n\nDo this for each sponsor:\n1. Read their documentation thoroughly\n2. Try their product or protocol\n3. Understand what problems they're trying to solve\n4. Join their Discord and ask questions\n5. Note which bounties have the best prize-to-competition ratio\n\n### Week 2: Form Your Team and Pick Your Battle\n\nThe ideal hackathon team has:\n- **1-2 smart contract developers** (Solidity/Vyper)\n- **1-2 frontend developers** (React, Next.js)\n- **1 designer or UX person** (optional but valuable)\n- **1 \"business brain\"** who can pitch and identify use cases\n\n**Pro tip:** You don't need all these roles filled. A team of 2-3 focused individuals often outperforms larger teams.\n\n## The Golden Rule: Pick Bounties Before the Hackathon\n\nThis is the single most important piece of advice: **Don't wait until the hackathon starts to decide what to build.**\n\nBy the time the opening ceremony ends, you should already know:\n- Which 3-4 sponsor bounties you're targeting\n- The core functionality of your project\n- How each team member will contribute\n\n## Day 1: The First 12 Hours\n\n### Hour 0-2: Attend Sponsor Workshops\n\nMost sponsors host quick technical workshops. Attend the ones for your target bounties. This is where you:\n- Learn implementation shortcuts\n- Get face time with sponsor engineers\n- Ask clarifying questions about bounty requirements\n\n### Hour 2-8: Build the Core\n\nFocus ruthlessly on the **minimum viable demo**. Your goal isn't to build a complete product—it's to build something that:\n1. Clearly demonstrates the concept\n2. Integrates the sponsor technology correctly\n3. Works reliably during the demo\n\n### Hour 8-12: Integration and Testing\n\nConnect your frontend to your contracts. Test the happy path repeatedly. Fix the bugs that break the demo.\n\n## Day 2: Polish, Pitch, Prepare\n\n### Hour 12-20: Feature Completion\n\nAdd the features that make your demo compelling, but **never sacrifice stability for features**. A working simple project beats a broken complex one every time.\n\n### Hour 20-24: Prepare Your Pitch\n\nYour pitch matters as much as your code. Structure it like this:\n\n1. **Problem (30 seconds):** What real-world problem are you solving?\n2. **Solution (45 seconds):** How does your project solve it?\n3. **Demo (90 seconds):** Show, don't tell\n4. **Technical depth (30 seconds):** What sponsor tech did you use and why?\n5. **Future vision (30 seconds):** Where could this go?\n\n**Practice your pitch at least 10 times.** Time it. Refine it.\n\n## Pro Tips from Hackathon Champions\n\n### 1. The \"Multi-Bounty Stack\"\n\nThe winning strategy is to build one project that qualifies for multiple bounties. For example:\n- Use **Chainlink** for price feeds → Chainlink bounty\n- Deploy on **Base** → Base bounty\n- Use **Safe** for multi-sig → Safe bounty\n- Implement **ENS** for identity → ENS bounty\n\nOne project, four chances to win.\n\n### 2. Talk to Sponsor Engineers\n\nSponsor engineers are there to help you win. They want projects using their technology. Visit their booths, explain your idea, ask for feedback. They'll often tell you exactly what judges are looking for.\n\n### 3. The README Matters\n\nJudges often review your GitHub before watching your pitch. A clean README with:\n- Clear project description\n- Architecture diagram\n- Setup instructions\n- Screenshots/video\n- Links to sponsor tech used\n\nThis can be the difference between winning and losing.\n\n### 4. Sleep Strategy\n\nThis might be controversial, but: **get at least 4-5 hours of sleep.** A rested brain writes better code and gives better pitches. Plan your sleep around your productivity patterns.\n\n### 5. Network Strategically\n\nHackathons are networking goldmines. Between coding sessions:\n- Meet other teams (they might become collaborators or co-founders)\n- Talk to VCs who attend these events scouting\n- Connect with protocol teams who might want to hire or fund you\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n❌ **Building without a clear bounty strategy**\n\n❌ **Overcomplicating the project**\n\n❌ **Neglecting the pitch**\n\n❌ **Not testing the demo**\n\n❌ **Going solo when team options exist**\n\n❌ **Ignoring documentation and README**\n\n## After the Hackathon: Maximize Your Win\n\nWhether you win or not, the hackathon shouldn't end when the event does:\n\n1. **Follow up with sponsors** who liked your project\n2. **Apply to accelerators** that recruit from ETHGlobal\n3. **Continue building** if the idea has legs\n4. **Write about your experience** to build your reputation\n5. **Stay connected** with your team and new friends\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nWinning your first ETHGlobal hackathon is absolutely achievable if you:\n- Prepare before the event starts\n- Target specific bounties strategically\n- Build something simple that works flawlessly\n- Deliver a compelling pitch\n- Leverage the multi-bounty strategy\n\nThe skills you develop at hackathons—rapid prototyping, working under pressure, pitching technical concepts—are valuable far beyond the prize money. Many of Web3's most successful founders got their start exactly where you're about to begin.\n\nSee you at the next ETHGlobal. 🚀"
