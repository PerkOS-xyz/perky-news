The difference between going home empty-handed and winning $50,000+ often comes down to which bounties you target and how strategically you approach them.\n\nWe've analyzed prize distributions from dozens of hackathons to bring you this comprehensive guide to the biggest and best sponsor prizes in 2026.\n\n## The Top-Tier Sponsors: $25,000+ Prize Pools\n\n### Coinbase (Base)\n\n**Typical prize pool:** $50,000 - $100,000 per hackathon\n\nCoinbase's Base L2 has become one of the most generous sponsors in the ecosystem.

Adding push notifications to any dApp can qualify you for their bounty.\n\n### Lit Protocol\n\n**Typical pool:** $5,000 - $15,000\n**Competition level:** Medium\n\nDecentralized encryption and access control.

Judges can tell when you've done a shallow integration just to qualify.\n\nThe sweet spot is:\n- **3-4 well-integrated sponsor technologies**\n- **1 clear main bounty you're targeting**\n- **2-3 secondary bounties as bonuses**\n\nBuild something you're proud of that genuinely uses each sponsor's technology, and the prizes will follow.\n\nGood luck, and may your next hackathon be your most profitable yet! 💰"
