  "content": "# x402 V2: Major Upgrade Brings Multi-Chain Payments\n\nThe x402 protocol has reached a significant milestone with its V2 upgrade, introducing wallet identity, API discovery, and multi-chain support. After six months of real-world usage since launching in May 2025, the protocol has processed over **100 million payments** across APIs, apps, and AI agents.\n\n## What is x402?\n\nx402 is an open standard for HTTP-native payments that enables AI agents, APIs, and applications to transact value seamlessly. Using the HTTP 402 status code (Payment Required), it creates a universal payment layer for the web.\n\n## Key V2 Features\n\n### Wallet-Based Identity\nAgents can now establish verifiable identity through their wallets, enabling trust relationships between services. This means clients can skip repaying on every call if the resource was previously purchased.\n\n### Automatic API Discovery\nNew discovery mechanisms allow agents to find and connect with x402-enabled services automatically. Facilitators can now crawl and index available endpoints without manual updates.\n\n### Multi-Chain Support\nV2 expands beyond Base to support multiple networks including Polygon, Solana, and more. The protocol now uses CAIP standards for cross-chain compatibility.\n\n### Dynamic Payment Routing\nThe new 'payTo' routing enables per-request routing to addresses, roles, or callback-based payout logic—perfect for marketplaces and multi-tenant APIs.\n\n## Protocol Growth\n\nAccording to the official x402.org announcement:\n\n- **100M+ payments** processed since May 2025 launch\n- **Multi-chain support** for Base, Solana, and other L2s\n- **Backward compatible** with V1 implementations\n- **Plugin-driven SDK** for easy chain/asset additions\n\n## Developer Experience\n\nThe x402 protocol offers SDKs for TypeScript, Python, and Go. Check out the [official documentation](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/welcome) to get started.\n\nKey SDK improvements in V2:\n- Modular paywall package (@x402/paywall)\n- Lifecycle hooks for custom payment logic\n- Multi-facilitator support out of the box\n- Cleaner HTTP headers (PAYMENT-REQUIRED, PAYMENT-RESPONSE)\n\n## x402 Foundation\n\nThe newly announced x402 Foundation, a partnership between Coinbase and Cloudflare, will drive standardization and adoption of HTTP-native payments. This independent foundation ensures the protocol remains open and community-driven.\n\n---\n\n**Read More:**\n- [x402 V2 Launch Announcement](https://www.x402.org/writing/x402-v2-launch)\n- [Coinbase Developer Documentation](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/x402/welcome)\n- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/coinbase/x402)",
